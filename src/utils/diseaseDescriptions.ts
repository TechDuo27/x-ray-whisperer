  'SUPERNUMERARY TEETH': 'Supernumerary teeth are teeth that develop in addition to the normal number of teeth. They may occur in the primary or permanent dentition, can be single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral and may appear in any region of the dental arch.',
  
  'GROSSLY DECAYED': 'Grossly decayed tooth is a tooth in which dental caries has progressed extensively, leading to the destruction of a large portion of the tooth structure, often involving both enamel and dentin and in many cases extending close to or into the pulp.',
  
  'GROSSLY CARIOUS': 'Grossly carious refers to teeth with extensive dental caries that have caused significant destruction of the tooth structure, often involving multiple surfaces and approaching or reaching the pulp chamber. This severe form of caries requires immediate treatment to prevent further complications such as pulpal necrosis, abscess formation, or tooth loss.',
  
  'SPACING': 'Spacing is a type of malocclusion characterised by the presence of spaces or gaps between two or more teeth in the arch, due to descrepency between tooth size & jaw size, missing teeth or abnormal dental development.',
  
  'ROOT RESORPTION': 'Root resorption is a process in which hard tissues of a root like cementum and dentin are broken down & absorbed by the body, usually due to the activity of odontoclasts.',
  
  'ABRASION': 'Abrasion is the Pathological wearing away of the tooth structure caused by mechanical forces from external objects or factors other than tooth * to * tooth contact. It commonly results from habits such as aggressive tooth brushing, use of hard bristled brushing, or biting on hard objects leading to loss of enamel, usually at the cervical region of the teeth.',
  
  'DENTAL CARIES': 'Dental caries is defined as a Microbial disease of the calcified tissues of the teeth, which is characterized by the Demineralization of the inorganic portion & destruction of the organic substance of the tooth.',
  
  'BONE LOSS': 'Bone loss of the tooth is the Pathological reduction in the height & density of the alveolar bone that supports the teeth, leading to loosening, mobility or eventual tooth loss if untreated.',
  
  'CYST': 'A pathological cavity having fluid, semi fluid, or gaseous contents, which is not created by the accumulation of pus, and is usually lined by epithelium.',
  
  'IMPACTED TEETH': 'Impacted teeth are teeth that fail to erupt into the proper functional position in the arch within the expected time, due to obstruction by overlying gum tissue, bone, or adjacent teeth.',
  
  'MISSING TOOTH': 'A missing tooth refers to the absence of one or more teeth in the arch, which may occur due to congenital reasons, pathological causes (like dental caries, periodontal disease, trauma) or extraction. Missing teeth can affect oral function (chewing, speech), aesthetics (like smile & facial profile) & the overall health of the stomatognathic system by leading to drifting, tilting, supra eruption, malocclusion & bone resorption in the edentulous area.',
  
  'PERIAPICAL PATHOLOGY': 'Periapical pathology refers to inflammatory conditions affecting the tissues surrounding the apex of a tooth root, typically resulting from bacterial infection spreading from the pulp through the root canal system. This can manifest as periapical granulomas, cysts, or abscesses, often appearing as radiolucent areas on radiographs.',
  
  'BONE FRACTURE': 'Bone fracture in the oral and maxillofacial region refers to a break or crack in the jawbone (mandible or maxilla) or surrounding facial bones, commonly resulting from trauma, accidents, or pathological conditions. These fractures can affect tooth stability, occlusion, and facial aesthetics.',
  
  'TOOTH FRACTURE': 'Tooth fracture is a break or crack in the tooth structure that can involve the enamel, dentin, or pulp, ranging from minor enamel chips to complete crown-root fractures. These can result from trauma, bruxism, large restorations, or weakened tooth structure from extensive caries.',
  
  'CROWNS': 'Dental crowns are tooth-shaped caps that completely cover the visible portion of a damaged tooth above the gum line, restoring its shape, size, strength, and appearance. They are typically made from materials like porcelain, metal, or ceramic and appear radiopaque on radiographs.',
  
  'IMPLANTS': 'Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots, providing a stable foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures. They appear as highly radiopaque cylindrical or screw-shaped objects on radiographs and integrate with the surrounding bone through osseointegration.',
  
  'RCT TOOTH': 'Root Canal Treatment (RCT) tooth refers to a tooth that has undergone endodontic therapy, where the infected or inflamed pulp has been removed and the root canals filled with biocompatible material. These teeth appear with radiopaque filling material in the root canals on radiographs.',
  
  'RESTORATIONS': 'Dental restorations are materials used to repair or replace damaged tooth structure, including fillings, inlays, onlays, and other conservative treatments. They appear with varying degrees of radiopacity depending on the material used (amalgam being highly radiopaque, composite being radiolucent to slightly radiopaque).',
  
  'RETAINED DECIDUOUS TOOTH': 'A retained deciduous tooth is a primary (baby) tooth that remains in the mouth beyond its normal exfoliation time, often due to the absence of a permanent successor tooth or delayed eruption. These teeth may cause alignment issues and require monitoring or extraction.',
  
  'ROOT STUMP': 'A root stump refers to the remaining root portion of a tooth after the crown has been lost due to extensive decay, fracture, or incomplete extraction. These retained roots can harbor bacteria, cause infection, and may require surgical removal to prevent complications.',
  
  'INTERNAL RESORPTION': 'Internal resorption is a rare condition where the tooth structure is resorbed from within the root canal space, typically appearing as a radiolucent enlargement of the root canal on radiographs. It usually results from trauma, extensive restorative procedures, or orthodontic movement and can lead to tooth weakening or perforation.',
  
  'MANDIBULAR CANAL': 'The mandibular canal (also known as inferior alveolar canal) is an anatomical structure within the mandible that contains the inferior alveolar nerve and blood vessels. It runs through the body of the mandible and is typically visible on panoramic radiographs as a radiolucent band with radiopaque borders. Accurate identification of the mandibular canal is crucial for surgical procedures to avoid nerve damage.'
