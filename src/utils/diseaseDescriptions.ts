  'SUPERNUMERARY TEETH': 'Supernumerary teeth are teeth that develop in addition to the normal number of teeth. They may occur in the primary or permanent dentition, can be single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral and may appear in any region of the dental arch.',
  
  'GROSSLY DECAYED': 'Grossly decayed tooth is a tooth in which dental caries has progressed extensively, leading to the destruction of a large portion of the tooth structure, often involving both enamel and dentin and in many cases extending close to or into the pulp.',
  
  'SPACING': 'Spacing is a type of malocclusion characterised by the presence of spaces or gaps between two or more teeth in the arch, due to descrepency between tooth size & jaw size, missing teeth or abnormal dental development.',
  
  'ROOT RESORPTION': 'Root resorption is a process in which hard tissues of a root like cementum and dentin are broken down & absorbed by the body, usually due to the activity of odontoclasts.',
  
  'ABRASION': 'Abrasion is the Pathological wearing away of the tooth structure caused by mechanical forces from external objects or factors other than tooth * to * tooth contact. It commonly results from habits such as aggressive tooth brushing, use of hard bristled brushing, or biting on hard objects leading to loss of enamel, usually at the cervical region of the teeth.',
  
  'DENTAL CARIES': 'Dental caries is defined as a Microbial disease of the calcified tissues of the teeth, which is characterized by the Demineralization of the inorganic portion & destruction of the organic substance of the tooth.',
  
  'BONE LOSS': 'Bone loss of the tooth is the Pathological reduction in the height & density of the alveolar bone that supports the teeth, leading to loosening, mobility or eventual tooth loss if untreated.',
  
  'CYST': 'A pathological cavity having fluid, semi fluid, or gaseous contents, which is not created by the accumulation of pus, and is usually lined by epithelium.',
  
  'IMPACTED TEETH': 'Impacted teeth are teeth that fail to erupt into the proper functional position in the arch within the expected time, due to obstruction by overlying gum tissue, bone, or adjacent teeth.',
  
  'MISSING TOOTH': 'A missing tooth refers to the absence of one or more teeth in the arch, which may occur due to congenital reasons, pathological causes (like dental caries, periodontal disease, trauma) or extraction. Missing teeth can affect oral function (chewing, speech), aesthetics (like smile & facial profile) & the overall health of the stomatognathic system by leading to drifting, tilting, supra eruption, malocclusion & bone resorption in the edentulous area.'
